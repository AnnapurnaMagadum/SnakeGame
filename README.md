# SnakeGame
The Snake Game in this project is built using Java and the AWT and Swing libraries. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) where the player controls a snake, moving it around the screen to collect food. The game stores the snake's segments using an ArrayList, listens for key presses to control movement, and checks for collisions and boundaries to determine game over. You can also extend the game by adding features like restarting on game over and tracking the high score.
